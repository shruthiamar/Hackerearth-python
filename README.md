1. Jadoo, the Space Alien has befriended Koba upon landing on Earth. Since then, he wishes Koba to be more like him. In order to do so
he decides to slowly transcribe Koba's DNA into RNA. But he has to write a very short code in order to do the transcription so as not
to make Koba aware of the change.The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).The four 
nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

2. Jadoo, the space alien has challenged Koba to a friendly duel. He asks Koba to write a program to print out all numbers from 70 to 80.
Knowing perfectly well how easy the problem is, the Jadoo adds his own twist to the challenge. He asks Koba to write the program without
using a single number in his program and also restricts the character limit to 100.

3. Jadoo hates numbers, but he requires to print a special number "420" to recharge the equation of life. He asks your help to print the 
number but Since he hates numbers, he asks you to write the program such that there would not be any number in the code.
